# RFM Analysis

## Overview
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis is a marketing technique used to understand and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. By analyzing **Recency** (when the last purchase was made), **Frequency** (how often purchases are made), and **Monetary value** (how much is spent), businesses can gauge customer engagement, loyalty, and overall value.

This analysis enables businesses to create targeted marketing campaigns and personalized strategies for different customer segments.

## Key Metrics
- **Recency**: The date of the customerâ€™s most recent purchase.
- **Frequency**: The total number of purchases made by the customer.
- **Monetary value**: The total monetary value of the purchases made by the customer.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes customer IDs, purchase dates, and transaction amounts. You can access the dataset here:

## Customer Segmentation
Based on the average RFM score, customers are divided into three value segments:
- **High-Value**: Top 20% of customers based on RFM scores.
- **Mid-Value**: Next 30% of customers.
- **Low-Value**: Bottom 50% of customers.

## Customer Segment Examples
When segmenting customers based on RFM scores, we can create the following customer segments:

1. **VIP Customers**: High-value customers who make frequent and recent purchases with high monetary value. They are the most loyal and valuable customers.
2. **Regular Customers**: Customers who frequently make purchases but may not spend as much as VIPs. They contribute to steady sales.
3. **Dormant Customers**: Customers who have not made recent purchases but were once active. Targeted marketing strategies may be required to re-engage them.
4. **New Customers**: Recently acquired customers who made their first purchase. Nurturing them is crucial to building long-term loyalty.
5. **Churned Customers**: Previously active customers who haven't purchased in a long time. They require reactivation efforts to prevent permanent churn.
